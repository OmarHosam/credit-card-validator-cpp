# Credit Card Validator
another project I've made while learning C++
# How it works
its uses Luhn algorithm and the entire project was followed by [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-credit-card-number-validation/) tutorial
it uses regex to check for the credit card provider, here is a [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72768/how-do-you-detect-credit-card-type-based-on-number) question that I've used most for my regex
# Installation

You have to compile it by yourself using any compiler (personally using gcc)
